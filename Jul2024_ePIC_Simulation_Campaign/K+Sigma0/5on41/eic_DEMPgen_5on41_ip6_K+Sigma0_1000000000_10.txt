 1. If the first ratio is not ~1.0 (+/- 0.05), check the number of recorded events. If the number of recorded events is < 50,000, increase the number of attempted events to generate more data. If the the ratio does not converge to ~1.0, multiply all individual event weights by this factor during analysis. Alternatively, this number can be treated as a tolerance on weights.
 2. If the second ratio is large (> XX), then again, multiply all invidiual event weights by this factor during analysis. Again, this could also be considered as a tolerance on weights.
