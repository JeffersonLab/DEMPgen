# Instructions to generate the test sample
Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to install DEMPgen from GitHub: [https://github.com/JeffersonLab/DEMPgen](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/DEMPgen/releases). The test sample can be generated by running the following command in the `data/` folder:
```
./../build/DEMPgen ../Test_EIC.json
```
The output will include`.ROOT`, `.DAT`, and `.TXT` files, which will be saved in the `data/OutputFiles/` folder. The generated files will be identical to the files in the `data/OutputFiles/reference_output` folder.

The file `Test_EIC.json` contains all the configuration options for the EIC event generation. It is located in the `DEMPgen` folder.
